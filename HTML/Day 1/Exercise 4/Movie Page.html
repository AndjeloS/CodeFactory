    <p>
        The Movie "Spiderman across the spider-verse" is the sequel to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and follows the protagonis Miles Morales. <br>
        
        <br>
        
        Miles Morales has been struggling to balance his personal life with his life as Spider-Man. Meanwhile, Gwen Stacey has joined a team of Spider-People from other universes, the Spider Society, after her father, Captain George Stacey, accuses Spider-Gwen of killing that universe's Peter Parker. Although Miles and Gwen reunite, their time together is cut short by the appearance of The Spot, a villain who can produce portals from his body as a result of the collider from the last movie being destroyed and fusing with him since he was a scientist at Alchemax. <br>

        <br>

        Spot wants to ruin Miles's life after blaming him for his predicament, so he goes through other universes to find other colliders and grow more powerful. While in Mumbattan, where they meet Pavitr Prabhakar/Spider-Man India, Miles helps save the police inspector from falling debris before being called upon to the Spider Society. There, he meets hundreds of other Spider-People, including Jessica Drew/Spider-Woman and Miguel O'Hara/Spider-Man 2099. Miguel tells Miles that he stopped a Canon Event, which would have been the death of the inspector just like how many other Spider-People have experienced this loss. Disrupting a Canon Event can have devastating consequences on that universe. Miles realizes his father Jefferson, who is set to be captain in two days time, is in danger. Despite the Spider-People attempting to stop Miles from saving his dad, Miles outruns all of them and is sent to another dimension. <br>

        <br>

        Miles accidentally winds up in Earth-42, which is the universe where the spider that bit him came from. Here, Jefferson is already dead, his uncle Aaron is still alive, and the Miles of this universe has become the Prowler. Meanwhile, Gwen forms a team with Pavitr, Hobie Brown/Spider-Punk, Margo Kess/Spider-Byte, and the returning Peter B Parker (and his baby Mayday), Spider-Noir, Spider-Ham, and Peni Parker to go and save Miles. <br>
