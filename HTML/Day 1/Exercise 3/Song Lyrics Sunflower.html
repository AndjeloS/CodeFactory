            Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy <span><b>(ooh)</b></span> <br>
            Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <span><b>(ooh)</b></span> <br>
            Ayy, ayy <br>
            Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Needless to say, I keep her in check <br>
            She was a bad-bad, nevertheless <span><b>(yeah)</b></span> <br>
            Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck <span><b>(wreck)</b></span> <br>
            Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck <span><b>(wreck)</b></span> <br>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Needless to say, I'm keeping her in check <br>
            She was all bad-bad, nevertheless <br>
            Callin' it quits now, baby, I'm a wreck <br>
            Crash at my place, baby, you're a wreck <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Thinkin' in a bad way, losin' your grip <br>
            Screamin' at my face, baby, don't trip <br>
            Someone took a big L, don't know how that felt <br>
            Lookin' at you sideways, party on tilt <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Ooh-ooh-ooh <br>
            Some things you just can't refuse <br>
            She wanna ride me like a cruise <br>
            And I'm not tryna lose <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>Then you're left in the dust <br>
            Unless I stuck by ya <br>
            You're the sunflower <br>
            I think your love would be too much <br>
            Or you'll be left in the dust <br>
            Unless I stuck by ya <br>
            You're the sunflower <br>
            You're the sunflower</span> <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Every time I'm leavin' on you <span><b>(ooh)</b></span> <br>
            You don't make it easy, no <span><b>(no, no)</b></span> <br>
            Wish I could be there for you <br>
            Give me a reason to, oh <span><b>(oh)</b></span> <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Every time I'm walkin' out <br>
            I can hear you tellin' me to turn around <br>
            Fightin' for my trust and you won't back down <br>
            Even if we gotta risk it all right now, oh <span><b>(now)</b></span> <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            I know you're scared of the unknown <span><b>('known)</b></span> <br>
            You don't wanna be alone <span><b>(alone)</b></span> <br>
            I know I always come and go <span><b>(and go)</b></span> <br>
            But it's out of my control <br>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>And you'll be left in the dust <br>
                Unless I stuck by ya <br>
                You're the sunflower <br>
                I think your love would be too much <br>
                Or you'll be left in the dust <br>
                Unless I stuck by ya <br>
                You're the sunflower <br>
                You're the sunflower <b>(yeah)</b></span> <br>
